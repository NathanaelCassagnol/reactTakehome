# Frontend take home assignment for React.JS
## Requirements:
### Fork this repository
### Create utility function for sorting JSON lists
•	Test data is provided in src/data in JSON format

•	Test data is unsorted so in order to display it you will need a function that takes in the json file and returns it sorted by date

### Under Graphs tab add graphs for the user’s income and followers over time using the Recharts library.


•	Library located at https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts

•	Documentation located at https://recharts.org/en-US/

### Under Graphs tab implement the data blocks 
•	Data Blocks have set fields to display data

•	Fields currently display hardcoded values so to complete this step you would first need to create functions to get the required information then pass it to the screen

### Use CSS and Styling to make the layout more visually pleasing and adaptable to mobile devices

### Optional (not required but if implemented well would greatly improve your standing)

•	Create scrolling lists in the Transactions and Followers tabs using provided data

•	Create a dropdown that allows the timespan of the graphs be changed – aka you can select “last 7 days” – “last month” – “last year” - or "all time" and the graphs and data blocks will change in accordance to the set timespan

## Judging Criteria
•	Cleanliness of your code

•	Shown skill in CSS and React.JS

•	Adaptability to a mobile layout

•	How well your code works against edge cases: no data – data in wrong format – missing fields - ect
